I am a technologist at heart, a deep love for technology is how I got here. I have been dismantling hardware and fixing software since I was ten. I spent the last several years in Help desk related positions and decided I wanted something more challenging and left IT to move onto software. I have finished my computer science coursework and am now working on building a portfolio around the .NET framework and networking with other developers and am falling in love with the field all over again.
